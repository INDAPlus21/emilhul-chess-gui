# Chess GUI by Emil Hultcrantz

A playable chess GUI made using the [ggez](https://ggez.rs/) library. This program relies on the [murnion-chess](https://github.com/INDAPlus21/murnion-chess) chess engine by Felix Murnion for the underlying logic.

## Key Bindings

The program uses two keybindings:

* The esc key exits the application
* The R key resets the chess game to the begining
